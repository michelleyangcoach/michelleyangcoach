# Hi, I’m Michelle Yang — Life Coach for Communication & Inner Clarity

I believe everyone deserves to feel heard, understood, and empowered to express themselves authentically.

As a coach, I create a warm, judgment-free space where you can explore your fears, frustrations, and hopes. Together, we’ll unravel what’s holding you back and build the skills and confidence you need to communicate clearly, set healthy boundaries, and form more meaningful connections in every part of your life.

Having lived on five continents and speaking five languages—Portuguese, Chinese, English, German, and Spanish—I understand what it feels like to lose your voice in unfamiliar environments or struggle to express your needs when everything around you is shifting.

My approach blends deep listening, lived experience, and practical tools. I use real-life stories, metaphors, and emotionally attuned language to help you identify your emotions, clarify your needs, and communicate with courage and compassion.

**Let’s help you find your voice — and use it with confidence.**

## My Approach: A Simple 3-Step Cycle for Meaningful Change

### **1. Get to Know Yourself More Deeply**
Understand your thinking patterns, values, strengths, and goals. This foundation gives you clarity and confidence.

### **2. Map Out the Areas You Want to Improve**
Identify the relationships, habits, or life situations where you want more ease, connection, or alignment.

### **3. Formulate Your “Clear Ask”**
Define what you want, articulate boundaries, and adjust expectations so you can communicate with purpose—and be heard.
